# SQL 50 LeetCode Challenge Solutions

## Introduction
Welcome to my SQL 50 LeetCode Challenge repository! Here, you'll find my journey through the [Top SQL 50 study plan on LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/studyplan/top-sql-50/), with a goal of solving 5 challenges each day. Each folder represents a day's work and contains the solutions for that day's challenges.

## Repository Structure
- **Day 1 to Day 10 Folders**: Each folder is named according to the day of the challenge (e.g., `Day 1`, `Day 2`, etc.) and includes:
  - A markdown document that includes answers to the day's five SQL problems along with concise and understandable explanations.

## How to Navigate
- Select the folder corresponding to the day you are interested in (e.g., `Day 1`).
- Inside, you will find the SQL solutions for that day along with detailed explanations in the README.md.

## Goal and Learning
This challenge is not just about solving problems, but also about learning and improving SQL skills. The daily structure helps maintain a consistent learning pace.

## Contributing
Feel free to contribute by suggesting improvements or alternative solutions. Contributions that foster learning and better understanding of SQL are highly encouraged.
